🎧 ENHANCED AI VOICE REPORT (7 minutes):

"Khandoba Enhanced Intelligence Report. This is a comprehensive 
AI-generated analysis combining machine learning, rule-based 
inference, and knowledge graph reasoning. Report generated on 
December 4th, 2025.

DOCUMENT INTELLIGENCE:
Processed and indexed 15 documents using natural language processing.
Languages detected: English (14), Spanish (1).
Successfully extracted 47 entities, generated 89 tags, and classified 
documents into 5 primary topics.

Primary Topics:
- Legal: 10 documents
- Financial: 8 documents
- Confidential: 12 documents
- Business: 7 documents
- Technical: 3 documents

ENTITY NETWORK INTELLIGENCE:
Your documents contain a comprehensive network of:
- 8 unique individuals
- 5 organizations
- 6 geographic locations

Knowledge graph analysis reveals 12 entities connected by 18 relationships.
The most connected entity is John Smith with 7 relationships, indicating 
central importance in your document network.

AUDIO INTELLIGENCE:
Transcribed 3 voice memos totaling 12 minutes of audio.
Extracted 127 additional entities from audio transcriptions.
Key themes from audio: project planning, merger discussions, compliance.

LOGICAL INFERENCES:
Applied 6 categories of inference rules and generated 11 high-confidence 
deductions.

FINDING 1 - Network Analysis:
John Smith is a key person in your network.
Evidence: Appears in 5 documents with 7 total entity relationships.
Confidence: 95 percent.
Recommended Action: Create a dedicated organizational vault for all 
John Smith-related documents to improve access control and searchability.

FINDING 2 - Security Risk Assessment:
This vault contains high-value confidential information requiring enhanced 
protection.
Evidence: 12 documents marked confidential or legal. Average importance 
score of 87 out of 100.
Confidence: 90 percent.
Recommended Action: Enable dual-key authentication for this vault immediately. 
Priority: HIGH. Complete within next 24 hours.

FINDING 3 - Compliance Requirements:
HIPAA compliance measures recommended.
Evidence: Vault contains both medical and legal documents.
Confidence: 85 percent.
Recommended Actions:
1. Enable complete audit logging (CRITICAL, complete today)
2. Implement dual-key authentication (HIGH, complete within 48 hours)
3. Schedule quarterly compliance reviews (MEDIUM, complete this month)
4. Export audit reports for compliance officers (MEDIUM, ongoing)

PATTERN RECOGNITION:
Detected 3 significant communication patterns.

PATTERN 1 - Communication Chain:
John Smith and Acme Corporation appear together in 5 documents spanning 
March to June 2024.
Confidence: 100 percent.
This suggests an ongoing business relationship or active project.
Recommended: Create timeline view and ensure chronological organization.

PATTERN 2 - Topic Evolution:
Financial documents show progression from planning (March) to execution 
(June).
Confidence: 82 percent.
This indicates a structured project lifecycle.

KNOWLEDGE GRAPH INSIGHTS:
Central Entity Analysis: John Smith serves as a network hub connecting 
Acme Corporation, TechStart Inc, and 3 individual contacts.
Shortest path from John Smith to any other entity: Maximum 2 degrees of 
separation.
This tight network suggests John is either a key decision maker or primary 
point of contact for multiple initiatives.

DEEP INSIGHTS:

INSIGHT 1 - Document Priority:
Merger Agreement Draft v3 is the most important document with a score of 
95 out of 100.

Possible causes: Project deadline, merger activity, or compliance filing.

GEOGRAPHIC INTELLIGENCE:
All vault access from typical locations (San Francisco, New York).
No geographic anomalies detected.
Access pattern indicates normal business travel between offices.

THREAT ASSESSMENT:
Current threat level: MEDIUM.
Anomaly score: 35 out of 100.
