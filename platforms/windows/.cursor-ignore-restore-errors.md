# Cursor Project Loading - Expected Behavior

## About This Error

When opening this Windows project in Cursor on macOS, you may see restore errors. This is **expected and normal**. The project is configured for editing on macOS.

## What I've Fixed

1. ✅ Added `EnableWindowsTargeting=true` to allow project loading
2. ✅ Created `app.manifest` file (was missing)
3. ✅ Removed `RuntimeIdentifiers` that cause issues on macOS

## Expected Behavior

**In Cursor:**
- ✅ Project file should load
- ✅ Code editing works
- ✅ IntelliSense works (with C# Dev Kit extension)
- ⚠️ Package restore may show warnings (safe to ignore for editing)

**To Actually Build:**
- Must use Windows 10/11
- Requires Visual Studio 2022 or .NET 8 SDK on Windows

## If Project Still Won't Load in Cursor

1. **Reload Cursor Window:**
   - `Cmd+Shift+P` → "Developer: Reload Window"

2. **Check C# Extension:**
   - Ensure "C# Dev Kit" extension is installed
   - Check Output panel: View → Output → Select "C#" from dropdown

3. **Ignore Restore Errors:**
   - For editing purposes, restore errors can be ignored
   - Code completion and editing will still work

**The project is configured correctly for editing on macOS!**
