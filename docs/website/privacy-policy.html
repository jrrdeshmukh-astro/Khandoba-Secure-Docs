        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 2025</p>
        
        <p>At Khandoba Secure Docs ("Service"), provided by Open Street LLC ("we," "us," or "our"), we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our Service.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3>Zero-Knowledge Architecture</h3>
            <p>Your documents are encrypted with keys that never leave your device. Even our administrators cannot access your document content. We can only see metadata like file names and sizes. This is the foundation of our commitment to your privacy.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
        <p>We collect only essential information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> Your name and email address from Apple Sign In</li>
            <li><strong>Documents:</strong> The documents you choose to store in the Service</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Basic app usage statistics to improve the Service</li>
            <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Only when accessing vaults, for security logging purposes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All data is encrypted on your device before storage. We never collect sensitive information like passwords or payment details (handled by Apple).</p>

        <h2>2. Zero-Knowledge Architecture</h2>
        <p>Your documents are encrypted with keys that never leave your device. Even our administrators cannot access your document content. We can only see metadata like file names and sizes. This zero-knowledge architecture ensures that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your documents remain private and secure</li>
            <li>We cannot read, access, or share your document contents</li>
            <li>Only you have the keys to decrypt your data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
        <p>All documents are stored encrypted using AES-256-GCM encryption, the same standard used by military and financial institutions. Data is synced via Apple's CloudKit service and follows Apple's privacy standards. Your encrypted data is stored securely in Apple's data centers.</p>

        <h2>4. Location Data</h2>
        <p>Location data is collected only when accessing vaults, solely for security logging. This helps you track where your vaults were accessed and provides an audit trail for security purposes. Location data is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Never shared with third parties</li>
            <li>Only stored locally and in your encrypted vault logs</li>
            <li>Used exclusively for security and access tracking</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We never share your data with third parties. Your documents remain private and encrypted. Vault sharing features are controlled entirely by you. We do not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sell your data to advertisers or data brokers</li>
            <li>Share your documents with third parties</li>
            <li>Use your data for marketing purposes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The only exception is when required by law or to protect the rights and safety of our users.</p>

        <h2>6. HIPAA Compliance</h2>
        <p>Our encryption and zero-knowledge architecture support HIPAA compliance for medical document storage. Redaction tools help protect protected health information (PHI). However, you are responsible for ensuring your use of the Service complies with all applicable healthcare regulations.</p>

        <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the following rights regarding your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can view all your data within the app</li>
            <li><strong>Export:</strong> You can export all your data at any time</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete your account and all associated data through the app's Profile settings</li>
            <li><strong>Control:</strong> You control all sharing and access permissions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Account deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. All your data, including vaults, documents, and access logs, will be permanently deleted.</p>

        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Service is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected information from a child under 13, please contact us immediately.</p>

        <h2>9. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>AES-256-GCM encryption for all stored documents</li>
            <li>Biometric authentication (Face ID/Touch ID) for device access</li>
            <li>Zero-knowledge architecture ensuring we cannot access your documents</li>
            <li>Regular security audits and updates</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

        <h2>11. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>Your data may be transferred to and stored on servers located outside your country of residence. By using the Service, you consent to the transfer of your data to these servers. We ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
