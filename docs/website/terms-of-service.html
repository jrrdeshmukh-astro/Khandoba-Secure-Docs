You can manage or cancel your subscription in iOS Settings → Subscriptions or visit <a href="https://apps.apple.com/account/subscriptions" target="_blank">https://apps.apple.com/account/subscriptions</a>.</p>

        <h2>2. Service Description</h2>
        <p>Premium subscription provides unlimited vaults, unlimited document storage, AI-powered features, threat monitoring, and secure collaboration tools. Our Service uses military-grade AES-256 encryption and zero-knowledge architecture to protect your sensitive documents.</p>

        <p>You are responsible for:</p>
