## 🔍 VERIFICATION:

### Search Results:

**Code Search:**
```bash
grep -r "credit\|payment\|PaymentService" Khandoba\ Secure\ Docs --include="*.swift"
```
**Result:** Only legitimate references:
- ✅ `TermsOfServiceView.swift`: "Payment is processed" (subscription info)
- ✅ `IntelReportService.swift`: "balanced" (data analysis)
- ✅ No PaymentService references
- ✅ No credit system code

**UI Verification:**
- ✅ No "credits" in button text
- ✅ No "balance" displays
- ✅ No "cost" calculations
- ✅ All show "Premium" or "Unlimited"

---

## 🚀 NEW SUBSCRIPTION SYSTEM:

### What Users See:

**Before (Removed):**
- ❌ Credit balance
- ❌ "Cost: X credits"
- ❌ "Buy Credits"
- ❌ Balance warnings
- ❌ Transaction history

**After (Current):**
- ✅ "Premium" tab
- ✅ "$5.99/month" 
- ✅ "Unlimited" everywhere
- ✅ "Subscribe Now"
- ✅ Clean, simple UI

### Features:

**With Premium ($5.99/month):**
- ✅ Unlimited vaults
- ✅ Unlimited storage
- ✅ Unlimited documents
- ✅ AI intelligence
- ✅ Threat monitoring
- ✅ Access maps
- ✅ Family Sharing (6 people)
- ✅ All features included

---

## 📋 WHAT'S LEFT:

**In Documentation (Acceptable):**
- `docs/archive/*` - Historical files (kept for reference)
- `TermsOfServiceView.swift` - "Payment" in legal context (✅ correct)
- References to subscription "payment" (✅ correct)

**These are fine because:**
- Archives are historical records
- "Payment" in subscription context is accurate
- No functional credit code remains

---
