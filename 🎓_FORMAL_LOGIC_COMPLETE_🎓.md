## 🧮 **MATHEMATICAL RIGOR**

### **Formulas Implemented:**

```
DEDUCTIVE:
├─ P→Q, P ⊢ Q (Modus Ponens)
├─ P→Q, ¬Q ⊢ ¬P (Modus Tollens)
├─ P→Q, Q→R ⊢ P→R (Hypothetical Syllogism)
└─ P∨Q, ¬P ⊢ Q (Disjunctive Syllogism)

INDUCTIVE:
├─ ∀x∈Sample P(x) → ∀x∈Population P(x)
├─ P(Sample) = n% → P(Population) ≈ n%
└─ Past(P) → Future(P)

STATISTICAL:
├─ P(H|E) = P(E|H)×P(H) / P(E) (Bayes)
├─ CI = μ ± (z × σ/√n) (Confidence Interval)
└─ J(A,B) = |A∩B| / |A∪B| (Jaccard Similarity)

TEMPORAL:
├─ □P (Always)
├─ ◇P (Eventually)
├─ P U Q (Until)
└─ P S Q (Since)

MODAL:
├─ □P (Necessarily)

## 🎙️ **SAMPLE ENHANCED VOICE REPORT**

**With Formal Logic Integration:**

> "Formal Mathematical Reasoning Analysis:
> 
> DEDUCTIVE LOGIC: Logically certain conclusion - Vault security is compromised. Using modus tollens: If vault secure, then no impossible travel occurs. Impossible travel WAS detected. Therefore, vault is NOT secure. Certainty: 100 percent. This is a logical proof, not a probability.
> 
> Formula: P implies Q, not Q, therefore not P.
> 
> REQUIRED ACTION (Deductively certain): Change all vault access credentials immediately.
> 
> INDUCTIVE LOGIC: Pattern generalization - John Smith typically creates confidential documents. Evidence: 8 out of 10 observed documents from John are confidential. Using enumerative induction, we generalize: All John Smith documents are likely confidential. Confidence: 94 percent.
> 
> Formula: For all x in sample, P of x implies for all x in population, P of x, probably.
> 
> ABDUCTIVE LOGIC: Best explanation analysis considered 3 hypotheses for night access spike. Hypothesis 1: Unauthorized access from different timezone has 70 percent likelihood. Hypothesis 2: Legitimate deadline work has 25 percent likelihood. Hypothesis 3: System error has 5 percent likelihood. Best explanation: Unauthorized access.
> 
> Formula: Q observed, P would explain Q, therefore probably P.
> 
> STATISTICAL REASONING: Bayesian inference reveals probability of active breach is 32 percent. Prior probability was 5 percent. Evidence updated this to 32 percent using Bayes' theorem. Formula: P of hypothesis given evidence equals P of evidence given hypothesis times P of hypothesis, divided by P of evidence.
> 
> While 32 percent is not certain, it exceeds our 30 percent threshold and warrants immediate investigation.
> 
> SYNTHESIS: Multiple formal reasoning systems provide converging evidence:
> - Deductive: 100% certain vault compromised
> - Inductive: 94% confident abnormal pattern
> - Abductive: 70% likely unauthorized access
> - Statistical: 32% calculated breach risk
> 
> Combined assessment: HIGH PROBABILITY SECURITY INCIDENT.
> 
> Mathematical confidence in recommendation: 85 percent.
> 
> This analysis combines symbolic logic, probability theory, and AI reasoning to provide the highest quality intelligence possible."
