## Step 2: App Store Metadata

### 2.1 App Description (Updated for Paid App)

```
🔐 KHANDOBA - AI-Powered Security Vault

The world's first vault app with AI voice intelligence and ML-powered threat detection.

🎙️ AI VOICE SECURITY REPORTS
Get comprehensive security briefings narrated by AI. Listen to threat analysis, access patterns, and step-by-step security recommendations—all in plain English.

🤖 ML AUTO-APPROVAL
Our machine learning system automatically approves or denies vault access based on threat metrics, geographic location, and behavioral patterns. No more manual approvals for low-risk requests.

📊 SOURCE/SINK INTELLIGENCE
Understand where your documents come from. Our AI classifies every document as "source" (created by you) or "sink" (received from others), providing context-aware security analysis.

🌍 GEOGRAPHIC INTELLIGENCE
Impossible travel detection prevents unauthorized access. If someone accesses your vault from New York at 3 PM and Los Angeles at 3:30 PM, our AI knows that's impossible and auto-denies the request.

🎯 ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS
Not just "what" but "how" and "when." Every threat comes with:
• Specific action steps
• Priority levels (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
• Timeframes for completion
• Detailed rationale

🗓️ AUTOMATED SECURITY SCHEDULING
Set up recurring security reviews. Our system automatically schedules:
• Daily reviews for critical vaults
• Weekly for high-risk vaults
• Monthly for standard vaults
Syncs with your iOS calendar.

FEATURES INCLUDED:
• Military-Grade AES-256 Encryption
• AI Threat Detection & Analysis
